## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup
This project consists of **two main parts**:
1. **Frontend** (React-based UI)
2. **Backend** (Node.js with Express and MongoDB)

Ensure you have **Node.js** and **MongoDB** installed on your system before proceeding.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CallSmart.git
cd CallSmart
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Setup**
Navigate to the `backend` folder and install dependencies.

```sh
cd backend
npm install
```

#### **Required Dependencies**
Install the necessary TypeScript-related dependencies:
```sh
npm install typescript ts-node @types/node @types/express @types/mongoose
```

Install required backend dependencies:
```sh
npm install express mongoose cors dotenv
```

#### **Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` directory and configure your MongoDB connection:
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Backend Server**
Start the backend server using **TypeScript**:
```sh
npx ts-node src/server.ts
```
The server will be running on **http://localhost:5000**.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Setup**
Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install dependencies.
```sh
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
Run the frontend application:
```sh
npm start
```
The frontend will be running on **http://localhost:3000**.

## üìå Development Workflow
To maintain a clean and structured development process, follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT commit directly to `main`**.
2. Always create a new branch for each specific task:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature-task-name
   ```
3. Work on your branch, make commits, and push changes:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added feature X"
   git push origin feature-task-name
   ```
4. Before merging, discuss the changes with the team.
5. Open a pull request (PR) and get approval before merging to `main`.
